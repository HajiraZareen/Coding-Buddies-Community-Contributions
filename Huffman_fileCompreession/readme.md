# Huffman Coding Compression (C++)

## Introduction

This C++ project demonstrates the implementation of the Huffman coding algorithm for text compression. Huffman coding is a lossless data compression technique that assigns variable-length codes to characters based on their frequencies, resulting in efficient data compression.

This README provides an overview of the project, its prerequisites, usage instructions, the structure of the code, features, sample usage, and details on contributing and licensing.

## Prerequisites

Before using this project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, Visual C++)
- Basic knowledge of C++ programming
- Input text files for compression

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt.

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd huffman-compression-cpp
Compile the C++ program:

bash
Copy code
g++ huffman_compression.cpp -o huffman
To compress a text file, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
./huffman -c input.txt
Replace input.txt with the name of the text file you want to compress. The program will generate compressed.huf and huffman_codes.txt.

File Structure
The project is organized as follows:

huffman_compression.cpp: The main C++ source code for compression.
sample_input.txt: An example input text file for testing.
compressed.huf: The compressed output of the sample input file.
huffman_codes.txt: The file containing Huffman codes.
Features
Compression of text files using Huffman coding.
Huffman code generation and storage in a separate file.
Simple and efficient implementation in C++.
Sample Usage
Compression
bash
Copy code
./huffman -c sample_input.txt
