# Two-Player Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players using the tkinter library in Python. Players take turns to place their symbol (X or O) on a 3x3 grid, and the first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If the grid fills up and no player wins, the game ends in a tie.

## Features

- Two players can take turns to play the game.
- The game checks for a win or a tie and displays a message when the game ends.
- Players can click on the grid to make their moves.
- The game is played in a graphical user interface created with tkinter.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script to start the game.
2. Click on an empty cell on the grid to make your move.
3. The game checks for a win or a tie.
4. If a player wins, a message will be displayed, and you can start a new game.
5. If the game ends in a tie, a tie message will be displayed, and you can start a new game.
